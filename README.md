# GroupProjectForSE
## Background
This project is a digital gym system urgently needed for a small gym in London 
The whole project is written by *Java*. 
The Java SDK version we use is **14.0.2**.
We use mostly *Java Swing* and a little bit *Java FX* for the UI.
If you want to modify it, you may need the plugin JFormDesigner. 
## Installation
You could just simply clone this project to your PC and down load the zip **video.zip** from the link below.

Then unpack it, put it under the directory **"GroupProjectForSE/video"**
Finally you could build and start the program by *Main* class.
## Usage
You could use different identities of users to log in and use the function.
The id and the password have been saved in xml files in *"/data"*.
**NOTICE** : This program is not multithreading safe.
## Database
We use 7 xml files in */data* to store the data and SAX parser in *dom4j*.
